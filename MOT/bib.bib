  abstract = {We have developed a compact vacuum system for laser cooling and spectroscopy of neutral thulium atoms. Compactness is achieved by obviating a classical Zeeman slower section and placing an atomic oven close to a magneto-optical trap (MOT), specifically at the distance of 11 cm. In this configuration, we significantly gained in solid angle of an atomic beam, which is affected by MOT laser beams, and reached 1 million atoms loaded directly in the MOT with only 15 mW of MOT cooling beams net power. By exploiting Zeeman-like deceleration of atoms with an additional laser beam and tailoring the MOT magnetic field gradient with a small magnetic coil, we demonstrated trapping of up to 13 million atoms. These results show great perspective of the developed setup for realizing a compact high-performance optical atomic clock based on thulium atoms.},

We have developed a high-ﬂux compact cold-atom source based on a pyramid MOT with a unique adjustable aperture that is highly suitable for portable quantum technology devices, including space-based experiments. The adjustability enabled an investigation into the previously unexplored impact of aperture size on the atomic ﬂux, and optimisation of the aperture size allowed us to demonstrate a higher ﬂux than any reported cold-atom sources that use a pyramid, LVIS, 3D-MOT or grating MOT. We achieved 2.0(1) × 1010 atoms/s of 87Rb with a mean velocity of 32(1) m/s, FWHM of 27.6(9) m/s and divergence of 58(3) mrad. Halving the total optical power to 195 mW caused only a 26\% reduction of the ﬂux, and a 33\% decrease in mean velocity. Methods to further decrease the velocity as required have been identiﬁed. The low power consumption and small size make this design suitable for a wide range of cold-atom technologies.},

              Messy, interacting quantum-mechanical systems are difficult to analyze theoretically. In a single spatial dimension, the calculations are still tractable, and experiments have recently confirmed the prediction that sufficiently strong disorder can disrupt the transport of interacting particles. In two dimensions, however, the theoretical blueprint is missing. Choi

            Single-site imaging in a two-dimensional optical lattice filled with interacting rubidium atoms shows that disorder can prevent thermalization.
          , 
            A fundamental assumption in statistical physics is that generic closed quantum many-body systems thermalize under their own dynamics. Recently, the emergence of many-body localized systems has questioned this concept and challenged our understanding of the connection between statistical physics and quantum mechanics. Here we report on the observation of a many-body localization transition between thermal and localized phases for bosons in a two-dimensional disordered optical lattice. With our single-site–resolved measurements, we track the relaxation dynamics of an initially prepared out-of-equilibrium density pattern and find strong evidence for a diverging length scale when approaching the localization transition. Our experiments represent a demonstration and in-depth characterization of many-body localization in a regime not accessible with state-of-the-art simulations on classical computers.},

Ultracold atom–based quantum simulators have already been used to probe quantum magnetism, to realize and detect topological quantum matter, and to study quantum systems with controlled long-range interactions. Experiments on many-body systems out of equilibrium have also provided results in regimes unavailable to the most advanced supercomputers.

title = {Testing gravity with cold atom interferometry: results and prospects},
journal = {Quantum Science and Technology},
abstract = {Atom interferometers have been developed in the last three decades as new powerful tools to investigate gravity. They were used for measuring the gravity acceleration, the gravity gradient, and the gravity-field curvature, for the determination of the gravitational constant, for the investigation of gravity at microscopic distances, to test the equivalence principle of general relativity and the theories of modified gravity, to probe the interplay between gravitational and quantum physics and to test quantum gravity models, to search for dark matter and dark energy, and they were proposed as new detectors for the observation of gravitational waves. Here I describe past and ongoing experiments with an outlook on what I think are the main prospects in this field and the potential to search for new physics.}

abstract = {An overview of the theory of the magneto-optical trap is presented, along with measurements of the effect of an imbalance in the intensities of the trapping beams. This investigation tests the theory of the spring constant of the trap and confirms that the confining force at the center of the trap results from an induced orientation of the atomic ground state. The experimental results give the magnitude of this force, which has not yet been calculated accurately. We calculate the radiation field in the three-dimensional molasses, finding that the relative time phase of the orthogonal standing waves is significant, and we give some insight into the phenomenon of interference fringes when the beams are misaligned. We also discuss the limitation of the trapped atomic density resulting from photon scattering within the cloud, predicting that densities above 1013 atoms/cm3 could be achieved in a trap operating at low saturation of the atomic transition. Finally, we briefly consider collisional loss at low densities, finding an especially large contribution from resonant dipole--dipole scattering.},
